  {
    question: "Is the sample item really free at the beginning?",
    answer: "Yes. 100%. We know that there are many agencies and freelancers who want to convince you how good they are with great pitching decks and presentations. We at DripText do things differently. We convince you through performance. Order a first, free sample text on a topic of your choice today and decide for yourself based on the content provided whether we should work together in the future. And if the content doesnt convince you (which we don't think), you can still use it on your pages. No exceptions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with common AI tools?",
    answer: "Yes, at DripText we use tools based on artificial intelligence to make the daily work of our copywriters, editors and project managers easier. AI tools are mainly used in structuring content, defining relevant keywords, the ideal weighting of these keywords and internal processes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the collaboration with DripText work?",
    answer: "Our motivation is to ensure that you have as little hassle as possible. Given this, the process of working together is very simply structured. As a rule, working together begins with ordering a free sample text. This is done 100% automatically and digitally via our order form . You will then receive your final, proofread and SEO-optimized article back within one week. If you like this article, we'll schedule a 15-minute phone call with Markus to discuss your requirements. Based on this conversation, you will receive a digital offer from us. You can accept this directly online and we will get started. To begin with, we conduct keyword research and a content gap analysis. We incorporate the results of both analyses into your editorial plan. At the same time, our project management team creates your workspace and sets up your access. From now on, you can put your hands up and watch us create the best content your website has ever seen",
  },
  {
    question: "What tools do you use to ensure the quality of your output?",
    answer: "We utilize a range of tools to streamline our processes and enhance our content quality. For keyword research, we rely on the KW-Finder from Mangools and ahrefs.com, which also aids in content gap analysis. Project management is handled through Nifty PM and Motion.io. To adjust and optimize voice quality, we use Textmetrics.com, targeting a level of B-1, while DeepL Write helps us linguistically refine our output. ChatGPT and NeuroFlash are employed for uniform reader address adaptation. Document storage and customer backend are managed via Google Drive, and we integrate Formaloo within our digital processes. For offers and contracts, we use PandaDocs. Additionally, we have developed our own tools to help our copywriters and editors maintain a consistent structural approach during text creation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why can you offer your content comparatively cheaply?",
    answer: "We currently charge from 0.05 EUR/word net. Our entire team is completely digital. We don't have our own offices and therefore have no external fixed costs other than our tools. Furthermore, Daniel and Mirco have set up all processes and structures to ensure maximum efficiency. In this way, we can offer a very attractive price of 0.05 EUR/word netâ€“and still pay our employees an above-average salary.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I receive unrestricted rights to use the content after payment?",
    answer: "Yes. The right of use is transferred in full to our customers. Because we, as a legal entity, are not subject to the Artists' Social Insurance Fund, you as a customer even save yourself the hassle of billing this fund.",
  },
  {
    question: "What skills do you have that I should trust you?",
    answer: "Our founding team consists of four people: Karolin, Daniel, Markus, and Mirco. Karolin is our Head of Back Office, handling all administrative threads in the company. With years of experience in the agency business, she set up all structures at DripText for maximum efficiency. Daniel, as Head of Operations, manages the operational business and the detailed structuring of all processes. His meticulous planning ensures high-quality output, even during workload peaks. Mirco, our Head of Marketing, oversees all measures to attract potential clients. As a trained advertising psychologist and former head of one of Germany's largest digital agencies, he knows how to present DripText effectively. Markus, a seasoned SEO expert since 2011, trains the copywriters and directs the agency's strategic approach. He has been recognized as one of the most influential online personalities in the German-speaking SEO scene.",
